For example, the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a group under addition -- adding two integers gives another integer. The set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is a group under multiplication. The set of complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ is a group under multiplication.  \n",

            "\n",
            "Elements of a group also have an inverse operation that produces an element belonging to the group. For example, the inverse of addition is subtraction and the inverse of multiplication is division. The inverse of a matrix is the matrix that when multiplied by the original matrix gives the identity matrix.  Integers do not form a group under multiplication because there is no inverse operation for multiplication -- the inverse of any integer besides $\\pm 1$ is not an integer and therefore outside the group.\n",
