In our example, we had a rotation about the $z$-axis and when we took the derivative of $\\mathbf{R}$, we assumed that at that instant in time the axis of rotation is fixed. Therefore, the derivative of the rotation will also be about the $z$-axis. Given that the angular velocity $\\omega$ describes the instantaneous axis and rate of rotation, we can see that the angular velocity is about the $z$-axis and the rate of rotation is $\\dot{\\theta}$. For rotations not about a single axis, the result is not so simple to interpret -- you can try modifying the axis of rotation in the above example to see what happens to the result."
